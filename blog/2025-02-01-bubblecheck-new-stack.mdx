description: Let's look at my proposed new tech stack for BubbleCheck.

Last post, I talked about my legacy app's [old, outdated tech stack](./2025-01-30-revamping-bubblecheck.mdx).
Now, let's look at the new stack I hope to use.

## Goals of BubbleCheck's revamp

I have two main goals for this app rewrite:

1. To make BubbleCheck production-ready, which means usable, maintainable, and scalable, using modern technologies.
1. To learn about frameworks and technologies that I'm less familiar with.

## New frameworks and technologies

I spent some time researching frameworks and libraries that developers in 2024 are fond of.
The [StackOverflow 2024 Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology) was particularly helpful in identifying systems that would be helpful to learn, and would fit in nicely with my needs.

Some of these decisions might change as I dig in, but I'm trying my hardest to avoid [analysis paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis).

| Component                 | Technology                                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend Language          | Node.js (TypeScript)                              |
| Backend ORM               | Prisma                                            |
| Backend API Type          | GraphQL (graphql-yoga)                            |
| Web Server                | Likely express with nginx behind some API gateway |
| Backend Compute           | Lambda? ECS? TBD.                                 |
| Database                  | PostgreSQL                                        |
| Frontend Framework        | Svelte                                            |
| Frontend UI               | Tailwind CSS                                      |
| Frontend API Client       | Some GraphQL library (graphql-request or Apollo)  |
| Frontend Hosting          | Static files in a bucket behind an API gateway    |
| CI/CD Deployment          | GitHub Actions running Terraform                  |
| Infrastructure Management | Terraform on GCP                                  |

### Backend language

In my current line of work, I work almost exclusively in TypeScript and I've grown fond of typed languages.
While other web backend languages like PHP and Python have made strides towards typing in recent years, the TypeScript ecosystem is where I'm most comfortable.

### Backend ORM

The two big players in TypeScript ORMs are Prisma and TypeORM.
I played around with both, and both seemed to solve the problem I needed solved.
Both offered native database migrations, great docs, and an "ejector seat" so I can write my own SQL or extend the ORM as needed.

Prisma "felt" a little more intuitive. With almost [near-identical usage](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=%40prisma%2Fclient&package=typeorm&from=2024-01-30&to=2025-01-30) and both solving my problem, I selected Prisma.
