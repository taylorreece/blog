description: Add Material UI Icons to docusaurus
---

I wanted to add some [Material Design Icons](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline) to a [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) documentation page that I'm working on, but couldn't find a good tutorial on how to do exactly that. I'm relatively new to the React.js world, so I had to futz for a bit, but eventually got it figured out. <!-- truncate -->I figured I'd share, in case anyone else wants to add material icons to their Docusaurus site:

Install `@material-ui/core`

```bash
npm install @material-ui/core
```

Within your config file `docusaurus.config.js`, add an import of the material icons font family. See [docs](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/docusaurus.config.js#stylesheets)

```js
  stylesheets: [
    "https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons",
  ],
```

Within a `.mdx` file (blog or docs file), import the appropriate React component. Throw this just under your metadata block:

```javascript
import Icon from "@material-ui/core/Icon";
```

Finally, within your .mdx page you can pepper various icons:

```javascript
<Icon>face</Icon>
```
