description: What are the best (and worst) first words to guess in Wordle?
---

**Soare**. _noun. A young hawk._ If you're here for the "best" first word to use in Wordle, there it is.

### What is Wordle?

[Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) is the word game craze that gained extreme popularity in January of 2021.

The game is pretty simple: guess a daily 5-letter word.
You have six chances.
If you guess incorrectly, the letters in your guess are highlighted green, yellow and gray:

- Green indicates that the letter was correct, and in the right position
- Yellow indicates that the letter appears in the word, but not in that position
- All incorrect letters appear in gray

In this post, let's look at the best and worst words to start with in Wordle.

### The Strategy

Obviously some first guesses are better than others.
Friends on Twitter or Facebook have recommended words like `audio` or `rinse`, since those contain very common letters.
That makes sense - it's helpful to use words that yield a lot of yellow or green letters.
A guess like `xylyl` (which is a [real word](https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/xylyl)!) will likely result in an all-gray, largely wasted guess and would only eliminate words that contain X's, Y's and L's.

So... what makes a good guess?
In my opinion, a good guess not only gives you some correct letters, but _eliminates_ the largest set of possible solutions.
**Good news!**
It turns out, those two goals (lots of correct letters _and_ eliminates lots of possible solutions) go hand-in-hand - if you get a lot of correct letters, the number of remaining possible solutions becomes small.

### Programming a Solution

If you look at Wordle's source code, you'll find two sets of words: possible solutions, and a dictionary of valid guesses you can make:

![Words source code](/img/wordle/source-code.png)

For convenience I've posted the [possible solutions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorreece/wordle/main/solutions.txt) (of which there are 2,315), and [valid guess words](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorreece/wordle/main/words.txt) (12,972 words) in a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/taylorreece/wordle).

:::caution Bad code warning
**Disclaimer**: My code is terribly inefficient (like, `O(n^3)` bad).
I'm sure there's a better algorithm involving graphs and trees that runs in `O(n log n)` or whatever, but this runs in a few hours so it's _fine_...
:::

Next, I wrote up some code.
My [script](https://github.com/taylorreece/wordle/blob/main/index.js#L92-L117) went something like this:

```
for each guess:
  for each possible solution:
    - Compute the "green-green-gray-yellow-gray" pattern that this
      guess and solution combination make
    - Figure out how many possible solutions are still valid given
      that pattern
    - Record that number
```

That gives you an idea of how "good" each guess is for any given solution.

Once you have a set of numbers for each guess, figure out the **average** number of solutions that are eliminated by guessing some particular word.
Depending on the guess, the data had a pretty hard right or left-skew, so in my opinion **median** best represents the "average" here.
Given some solution, thus-and-such guess should yield about _N_ remaining options for solutions.

### The Results

After letting my little Macbook churn on my script for 4 hours, I had results.

The top 10 **best** words to start out a game of Wordle are:

| guess | Median words remaining | Mean words remaining | Standard deviation |
| ----- | ---------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| SOARE | 79.0                   | 219.75               | 304.9              |
| SAICE | 80.0                   | 232.78               | 318.85             |

A full report is available [here](https://github.com/taylorreece/wordle/blob/main/results.csv).

I mentioned that the data were skewed heavily right and left depending on what guess you had.
Here's the histogram for `soare`:

You can see that for many solutions, guessing `soare` reduces the possible solutions from 2,315 to just a few dozen!
