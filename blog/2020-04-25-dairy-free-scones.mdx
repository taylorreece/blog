## Background

Many (most?) recipes for scones involve milk, butter, or both.  That's pretty unfortunate for folks with dairy allergies.

<!-- truncate -->

This scone recipe is loosely adapted off of the [King Arthur Flour](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/scones-recipe) milk-and-butter-laden recipe.  I put in some substitutions to make it pseudo-healthy (whole wheat flour, applesauce for butter, etc).

They turned out very moist and delicious.  The strawberry / chocolate ones were slightly bitter; adding extra sugar to those may be worth-while.

## Ingredients

You will need:

* Flour (I used 50/50 white and whole wheat.)
* White Sugar
* Baking Powder
* Vanilla Extract
* Salt
* 1 Egg
* Apple Sauce
* Margarine (or other non-dairy butter)
* Almond Milk
* Cinnamon
* Your choice of mix-ins - I did half strawberry / chocolate, and half apple / cinnamon chips

## Recipe

In a mixing bowl, sift together your dry ingredients:

* 1 1/2 C Flour
* 1/4 C White Sugar
* 1/2 t Salt
* 1/2 T Baking Powder

Add your liquids:

* 1 Egg
* 2 T Softened Margarine
* 2 T Applesauce
* 1 t Vanilla Extract
* 1/3 C Almond Milk

Mix thoroughly with a spatula

Add mix-ins.  We split our dough in half, and added diced strawberries and dairy-free chocolate chips to half, and diced apples and cinnamon chips to the other half.

Place dough into a [scone pan](https://amzn.to/3aBSjZ7), or [shape them manually](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2016/05/30/freeze-and-bake-scones).

Sprinkle a mix of 1T white sugar and a dash of cinnamon over your scones.

Freeze for 30 minutes.  This, [per experts](https://victorianhousescones.com/freezing-scone-dough/), supposedly helps it rise.

Bake for around 20 minutes at 375Â°F
