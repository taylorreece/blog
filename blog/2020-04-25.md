## Background

Many (most?) recipes for scones involve milk, butter, or both.  That's pretty unfortunate for folks with dairy alergies.

<!-- truncate -->

This scone recipe is loosely adapted off of the [King Arthur Flour](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/scones-recipe) milk-and-butter-laden recpie.  I put in some substitutions to make it psudo-healthy (whole wheat flour, apple sauce for butter, etc).

## Ingredients

You will need:

* Flour (I used 50/50 white and whole wheat.)
* White Sugar
* Baking Powder
* Vanilla Extract
* Salt
* 1 Egg
* Apple Sauce
* Margarine (or other non-diary butter)
* Almond Milk
* Cinnamon
* Your choice of innards - I did half strawberry / chocolate, and half apple / cinnamon chips

## Recipe

1. In a mixing bowl, sift together your dry ingredients:

* 1 1/2 C Flour
* 1/4 C White Sugar
* 1/2 t Salt
* 1/2 T Baking Powder

2. Add your liquids:

* 1 Egg
* 2 T Softened Margerine
* 2 T Apple Sauce
* 1 t Vanilla Extract
* 1/3 C Almond Milk

3. Mix thoroughly with a spatula
