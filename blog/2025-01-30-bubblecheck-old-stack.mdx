title: BubbleCheck's Old Tech Stack

description: BubbleCheck runs on a pretty old tech stack. Let's look at what currently exists (and what needs to change).
---

In 2013 I built [BubbleCheck](https://bubblecheck.reecemath.com/), an automated grading tool that lets teachers design multiple choice exams, scan in their students' completed exams, and review the results.

Now, over a decade later, 308 teachers have used BubbleCheck to automatically grade a whopping of 48,000 exams.
Assuming each exam would have taken, say, 5 minutes to grade by hand, it's saved teachers a collective 4000 hours of grading.

At this point, I an confidently say that the project was worth it. [Relevant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1205/).

But, technology changes and BubbleCheck is built on a tech stack that is considered "ancient" at this point.

So, it's time to rebuild BubbleCheck with modern tools.

## BubbleCheck's old tech stack

In 2013 I reached for technologies that I was comfortable with - what people affectionately call a [LAMP stack](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)>) (**L**inux, **A**pache, **M**ySQL, **P**HP).
I had built some web apps on top of the LAMP stack for my college's student government website, [Oleville](https://www.oleville.com/), so the learning curve wasn't high.

I used the (latest and greatest at the time) version 5.x of [PHP](https://www.php.net/).
I knew that I didn't want to build an entire ORM layer myself, so I reached for [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), which I found very pleasant to work with.

Teachers generally scan students' exams to PDF files.
The processing of their PDFs is done in C++ using [MuPDF](https://mupdf.com/) to convert PDF scans to individual PNG images, and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) is leveraged to process the images.
Uploaded PDFs are processed by a [cron job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) that kicks off every minute.

The frontend is rendered server-side with Laravel and leverages the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS framework for UI elements.
The frontend communicates with the backend using [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

The web services does not scale.
From 2013 until 2017 I hosted BubbleCheck on a shared [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/) PHP node, backed by a hosted [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/).
Now, it's installed on a single `t2.micro` EC2 in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) that runs PHP, MySQL, and has a mounted [EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/) filesystem for storing scanned exams.

| Component                 | Technology                         |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Backend Language          | PHP 5.x                            |
| Backend ORM               | Laravel 4.2.x                      |
| Web Server                | Apache                             |
| Backend Compute           | Ubuntu Linux                       |
| Database                  | MySQL 5.7                          |
| Frontend UI               | Raw HTML and CSS (with Bootstrap)  |
| Frontend API Client       | jQuery                             |
| Frontend Hosting          | Server-side rendering from Laravel |
| CI/CD Deployment          | Manual `rsync` of new files        |
| Infrastructure Management | Manual                             |
| Image Processing          | C++ with OpenCV                    |

Obviously this tech stack is _old_.
Most components of my tech stack have been EOL'd for years.
It's time to revamp things.

In the upcoming blog posts, I'll write about my journey as I rebuild BubbleCheck using modern technologies, to make a maintainable, scalable web and mobile app, and I'll share my learnings along the way.
