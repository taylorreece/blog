[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/26d681a0-7513-4090-bf8c-00091f6d47ba/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/ecstatic-perlman-569f64/deploys)

# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

I currently use Netlify for deployment.
